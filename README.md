# [Tranquili-Tea](https://tranquili-tea.netlify.app/)

Third and final project of IronHack's Web Development bootcamp SÃ£o Paulo - Remote.

Tranquili-Tea is a website about teas, we did an **e-commerce** section where people can read about teas and all about their features and then buy some teas, all your orders are going to be saved in your profile. Besides e-commerce, we have a **forum**, our Tea Room, a space where people can share their experiences about teas, start new discussions, new threads, and know other peoples who love teas either. In their Tea Room Profile, they can see all posts and comments made and personalize their profile.

It's a full-stack project using **ReactJS, Node.js and MongoDB** and the libraries **Express, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bcrypt, cors, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, material UI, Tailwind, axios, date-fns**

Made by [Caroline](https://github.com/carolineabreu), [Larissa](https://github.com/larissambn) and [Zimarlen](https://github.com/ZihSilva).
